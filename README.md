# Collections Exercises 

## Description
IIn this task we will explore the fundamental concepts of Java collections, 
with special attention to the most common classes from the java.util library, 
such as ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, and ListIterator.
  
## Exercise Statement
Level 1: In this exercise, you will use two of Java’s most common collections: 
ArrayList and HashSet. You will practice adding and modifying elements, and you 
will observe how these collections handle duplicates. You will also practice 
list manipulation and the use of ListIterator. Finally, you will work with 
reading files, using collections such as HashMap, and interacting with the user 
through a small quiz game.

Level 2: In this level, you will work with collections such as HashSet and practice 
sorting objects using Comparable and Comparator. The goal is to understand how Java 
compares and organizes objects based on custom rules. You will also delve into the 
importance of overriding methods such as equals() and hashCode() to control duplicates, 
as well as how to sort custom objects.

Level 3: In this level, you will implement a small application to manage and display 
people read from a file. You will practice reading CSV files, creating interactive 
menus, and dynamically sorting objects according to different criteria (first name, 
last name, and ID number). The goal is to understand how to structure a modular 
application that allows reading, displaying, and sorting data in a flexible way.

## Features
The goal is to strengthen your understanding of how to create, modify, and 
traverse these data structures, as well as to observe their behavior in situations 
like duplicate management, object comparison, and element order manipulation. 
You will also practice file reading and writing, along with user interaction.
